# MobileNetV2 Model

## Project Overview
MobileNetV2 is an efficient model architecture designed for mobile and edge devices to perform image classification tasks. This project includes a MobileNetV2 model implemented using Keras, following the TensorFlow backend framework. The model is optimized for performance while maintaining high accuracy across various tasks in computer vision.

## Installation
To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can set up a virtual environment for better package management. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/mobilenetv2.git
   cd mobilenetv2
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   Ensure you have `pip` installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the MobileNetV2 model, you can load the model and make predictions on images. Here’s a simple usage example:

```python
import keras
from keras.models import load_model

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
model = load_model('path/to/model.h5')

# Prepare an image (ensure it is preprocessed appropriately, e.g., rescaled)
# ... Image loading and preprocessing code here ...

# Make a prediction
predictions = model.predict(image)
# Process predictions as per your requirement
```

## Features
- **Architecture**: Based on MobileNetV2 architecture designed for efficiency.
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts input images of size 224x224 with 3 color channels (RGB).
- **Transfer Learning**: Adaptable for various tasks in computer vision, enabling reuse of a pre-trained model with fine-tuning.
- **Support for Batch Processing**: Capable of processing batches of images for improved performance.

## Dependencies
This project has the following dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` or `package.json`:

- `tensorflow` (Keras API integrated)
- `numpy`
- `Pillow` for image handling
- `matplotlib` for visualization (optional)

You may check the `package.json` file to discover additional dependencies required for more advanced features.
